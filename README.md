# SQL Portfolio

This repository contains my SQL practice, test solutions, and learning notes.  
It's designed so potential employers can see how I approach real SQL problems.

## Contents

- `basics/` – simple SELECT queries, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting, and limiting.
- `joins/` – INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins, and multi-table joins.
- `aggregation/` – `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, aggregate functions, and summary queries.
- `window_functions/` – `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, running totals, and partitioned calculations.
- `practice_problems/` – end-to-end questions with problem descriptions and my solutions.

Each practice problem has:

- `problem.md` – a short description of the task.
- `solution.sql` – my answer query.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean, readable SQL (`SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`).
- Using window functions for rankings and advanced analytics.
- Breaking down business questions into SQL queries.
- Organising code in a clear, professional structure.

## How to Use

You can browse the `.sql` files directly on GitHub.

If you want to run them:

1. Load the relevant tables into your SQL database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
2. Open the `.sql` file.
3. Execute the query in your SQL client.
